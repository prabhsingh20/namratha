# React + Vite

React Vite Setup Guide
This guide will walk you through setting up a React project using Vite.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

Step 1: Create a new React project
You can create a new React project using the create-vite command provided by Vite.
npm init @vitejs/app my-react-app --template react

Replace my-react-app with the name of your project.

Step 2: Navigate to your project directory
Navigate to the directory of your newly created project.
cd my-react-app

Step 3: Start the development server
You can start the development server using the following command:
npm run dev

Step 4: Building for production
To build your React app for production, run:
npm run build
This command will generate an optimized production build of your app in the dist directory.

Step 5: Running tests
Vite also supports running tests. To run tests, use the following command:
npm run test

Additional Configuration
You can further configure your project by modifying the vite.config.js file in the root directory. This file allows you to customize Vite's behavior according to your project requirements.
